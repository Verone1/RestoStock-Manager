// this is the homepage for HO_Employee after log-in that will be returned as the response to an http request.

// You can assume that this page has some data/ variables returned from the Controller
// 1. the object of Employee class which has its all properties
//        emp.id    emp.name   emp.RestaurantID    emp.AvatarImage   etc

import Banner.js
import Footer.js
import MenuBar.js

// code for the content area ( loading View HO inventory by default )
